# JYR - Java for yr.no


A simple start of a Java API for the Norwegian weather service yr.no.

It's a basic class that can be used to fetch weather information from yr.no's XML api.
More about the xml API here:

There are a couple of integration tests for the Java YR code.

## Application
There is some basic UI, but it is decoupled from the yr API code.

A couple of screenshots from the GUI:
